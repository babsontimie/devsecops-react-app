React apps build into static files (HTML/JS/CSS) instead of a backend service, you need to:

In the repo is a standard production-ready Dockerfile for a React app (serving via NGINX)
âœ… This ensures your React app is bundled and served via NGINX.
âœ… This exposes your React frontend via a LoadBalancer service.

OWASP ZAP DAST
Since React is frontend-only, OWASP ZAP will scan your deployed UI for vulnerabilities (XSS, misconfigurations, etc.).
That works fine â€” just keep in mind thereâ€™s no backend API in this setup unless you deploy one alongside.
